You can copy and paste these directly into your own code.\n\n## 1.0 Introduction\n\nThe best way to think about DBMagic is the way you might think of some of the many language adapters for (R, Ruby, Julia, Scala, and a host of others).  The idea behind DBMagic was to create the ability to talk to a data source in its own language with absolute minimal knowledge of the structures being built and used under the sheets.\n\n###1.1 The Problem\n\nFor example, to make a database connection over ODBC, one has to write code that looks like this:"

Create the objects needed to query a data source.\n1. Establish a **connection** to the data source.\n1. Execute a **command** over the connection.\n1. **Fetch** and/or **skip** the records returned by the query.\n1. End the **connection** to the data source\n1. Release the objects required to query a data source.\n\nIn order to do this, we need to do quite a few things to shield the users from implementation details.  \n\n---------------\n\n##2.0 How It Works\n\nThe DB Magic interface appears just as any other [cell magic](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Cell%20Magics.ipynb) or [iPython Magic Function](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html)."

Note that this command is completely platform agnostic and doesn't even require a database connection.\n\n**`--list sources`** is an option that will list metadata about specific data sources that are available through ODBC.

However, You can specify other useful options (like **`--fetch`**, **`--commit`**, or **`--explain`**).\n\nA naked allows you to the same database operations in a way that might make more sense if you are coming from the database world.
