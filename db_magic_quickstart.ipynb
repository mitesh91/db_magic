This usually entails using  a lanaguage other than Python (like SQL) on a remote server.  However, historically this hasn't been particularly easy to do for non-programmers.\n\nThe idea behind DBMagic is to give the end user the ability the ability to speak to a data source in its own language with absolute minimal knowledge of the programming libraries and structures being built and used under the sheets."

Now, onto something more interesting.\n\n##Standard Queries\n\nAs we showed above, there are a couple forms that a query can take: <br>\n\n    %db <source> <command> <--option> <--option>\n    %db <command> <--option> <--option> ...\n\nWhere we are providing:\n\n|  Argument | Description   |\n|------|------|\n|**`<source>`** |a text string that will uniquely identify where the data is to be retrieved from.|\n|**`<command>`** | the text that is executed at the source|\n|** `--options`** | specific actions that can be taken for finer control of the process|\n\nSource and command are almost always present in a **`%db`** call, while there are many options available as part of working with a database.\n\n##Common Options Used With Connections\n\nThe most commonly used options are:\n\n|  Option | Description   |\n|------|------|\n| ** `--connect`**|  Connect to **`source`** |\n| ** `--disconnect`** | Disconnect from **`source`** |\n| ** `--uid`** | The user name to use to connect to **`source`** (optional) |\n| ** `--pwd`** | The password to use to connect to **`source`** (optional) |\n| ** `--commit`** | Commit a transaction to a database (optional) |\n| ** `--rollback`** | Roll back a transaction from a database (optional) |\n| ** `--fetch all`** |  Return some or all of the records from a command (optional) |\n| ** `--fetch <n>`** |  Return **`n`** records from a command (optional) |\n| ** `--skip <n>`** |  Skip the next **`n`** records returned from a command (optional) |\n| ** `--cleanup`** |  Disconnect all remaining connections (optional, done when DBMagic is closed) |\n\nWe will provide detailed examples of each of these.\n\n##Usage\n\nHere is a long-form example of how to:\n\n1.

This command is passed through directly to the underlying driver and to the database. |\n| ** `--rollback`** | Rolls back the current transaction to the database.  This command is passed through directly to the underlying driver and to the database. |\n\n\n###Fetching and Skipping Data\n\nExecuting queries are cool, but the most important thing is actually getting your hands on the data.  In order to do this, we need to use the **`fetch`** option.\n\n|  Option  |  Argument |Description   |\n|----------| -----------|------|\n| ** `--fetch`** | ** `all`** |  Returns all records.  If the query did not generate records, you may get back a warning message, but no exception. |\n| ** `--fetch`**| ** `<n>`** |  Returns n records, where n > 0.  This is most commonly used when there are a large number of records to return and you don't want them all at once.  This can be run multiple times if n is less than the number of records. |\n| ** `--skip`**| ** `<n>`** |  Skips n records, where n > 0.  The underlying driver will simply not deliver the records back to iPython. |\n\n### A Comprehensive Example\n\nHere is a comprehensive example that will:\n\n1. Connect to a data source\n1. Create a table.\n1. Populate the table.\n1. Commit the changes.\n1. Query the database and count the number of records.\n1. Fetch the results of the count.\n1. Print the results\n1. Clean up the table.\n1. Close the connection"

This can't be done directly on the **`db`** line, due to limitations in iPython.\n- We used a **`try/finally`** block because if the query fails there will be an exception generated.  With this pattern you will make sure that your connection gets shut down regardless of what happens.  Your error handling could be more complicated.\n- The **`results`** are returned as a list of rows and come directly from the underlying library (in this case it is a pyRow from pyOBDC).  **`results[0]`** would return the first row, **`results[n-1]`** would return the nth record.\n- You can also use the field name as part of a pyRow object.  Using **`results[n].age`** would return **`age`** field from the nth record.\n\n##Convienence Methods\n\nThere are a lot of options available in this package, but in reality for everyday use you don't need to use most of them.  ITo simplify, I have added some convenience methods that make coding a lot easier to do, with far fewer options.\n\n###Naked Queries\n\nlf you aren't a software developer, typically you want to issue a query and get back the results and not deal with configuration.  In order to facilitate this, we came up with the idea of a **naked query**.\n\nA naked query is the simplest way to issue a command to a database.\n\nInstead of specifying **`$dsn`** and **`--options`** on every line ...\n\n**`%db $dsn --connect \n%db $dsn $sql_create_table --commit\n%db $dsn $sql_drop_table --commit\n%db $dsn --disconnect`**\n\n... the SQL will look like: \n\n**`%db $dsn $sql_create_table\n%db $dsn $sql_drop_table`**\n\nAll the steps are taken care of for you, including connection to the database, query execution, fetching all records from the database, and disconnection from the database.  \n  \nIn order for DBMagic to detect that you are performing a naked query, it has to have the following characteristics:\n\n- There is not an existing connection with the same name/alias to this database\n- There is both a command and a data source specified\n- The data source specified is valid.\n- There are no connection-related options used (like **`--connect`**, **`--execute`**, **`--disconnect`**).  However, You can specify other useful options (like **`--fetch`**, **`--commit`**, or **`--explain`**).\n\nA **naked query** allows you to the same database operations in a way that might make more sense if you are coming from the database world.  This is very much akin to typing queries in a SQL tool.\n\nFor example, here are a few of the queries converted in our comprehensive example converted to 'naked' style.  "
